Personalization in E-commerce with Recommendation System is a web-based application designed to enhance the online shopping experience by offering personalized product suggestions to users. The goal of this project is to implement a recommendation system that analyzes user behavior, preferences, and browsing history to provide tailored product recommendations. The platform allows users to browse products, add items to the cart, and receive suggestions based on collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques. This not only improves user engagement but also boosts conversion rates for e-commerce platforms. The system is built using modern web technologies for the frontend (such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js) and integrates machine learning algorithms for the recommendation engine using Python and libraries like Pandas and Scikit-learn. The backend and database are designed to handle product data, user profiles, and interaction history efficiently. This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used in real-world applications to deliver smart, data-driven solutions for online retail.
